# TuringMachineExpanderNotes
Some notes and observations on making new modules with the Turing machine Expansion Protocol

For just information on how to connect an expander to a host you already have check out the hookup guide.

For notes on what I have learned through making these expanders as well on tip about how to make your own take a look at the notes document.

For information on the original Turing Machine Module and expanders check out https://musicthing.co.uk/

To buy a kit to make the Turing Machine and its expanders check out thonk.co.uk.

To buy Mystic Circuits modules that support the Turing Machine Expansion protocol such as Tree and Leaves go to www.MysticCircuits.com

Thank you for checking out this info.
